        <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 50px;">10 Health Tips For 2023</h1>
        <p>31 December 2019
        The start of a new decade brings with it new resolutions to improve one’s life, including a healthier lifestyle.
        Here are 20 practical health tips to help you start off towards healthy living in 2020.</p>

        <h1 >1. Eat a healthy diet</h1>
        <img src="food.jpg" alt="" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border-radius: 0%;"> <br><hr><br>
       
        <p>Eat a combination of different foods, including fruit, vegetables, legumes, nuts and whole grains. Adults should
        eat at least five portions (400g) of fruit and vegetables per day. You can improve your intake of fruits and
        vegetables by always including veggies in your meal; eating fresh fruit and vegetables as snacks; eating a
        variety of fruits and vegetables; and eating them in season. By eating healthy, you will reduce your risk of
        malnutrition and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer.</p>

        <h1>2. Consume less salt and sugar</h1>
        <img src="salt.webp" alt="" style="height: 500px; width: 100%; border-radius: 0%;"> <br><hr><br>
       
        <p>Filipinos consume twice the recommended amount of sodium, putting them at risk of high blood pressure, which in
        turn increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. Most people get their sodium through salt. Reduce your salt
        intake to 5g per day, equivalent to about one teaspoon. It’s easier to do this by limiting the amount of salt,
        soy sauce, fish sauce and other high-sodium condiments when preparing meals; removing salt, seasonings and
        condiments from your meal table; avoiding salty snacks; and choosing low-sodium products.

        On the other hand, consuming excessive amounts of sugars increases the risk of tooth decay and unhealthy weight
        gain. In both adults and children, the intake of free sugars should be reduced to less than 10% of total energy
        intake. This is equivalent to 50g or about 12 teaspoons for an adult. WHO recommends consuming less than 5% of
        total energy intake for additional health benefits. You can reduce your sugar intake by limiting the consumption
        of sugary snacks, candies and sugar-sweetened beverages.</p>

        <h1>3. Reduce intake of harmful fats</h1>
        <img src="fat.jpg" alt="" style="height: 500px; width: 100%; border-radius: 0%;"> <br><hr><br>
       
        <p> consumed should be less than 30% of your total energy intake. This will help prevent unhealthy weight gain
        and NCDs. There are different types of fats, but unsaturated fats are preferable over saturated fats and
        trans-fats. WHO recommends reducing saturated fats to less than 10% of total energy intake; reducing trans-fats
        to less than 1% of total energy intake; and replacing both saturated fats and trans-fats to unsaturated fats.

        The preferable unsaturated fats are found in fish, avocado and nuts, and in sunflower, soybean, canola and olive
        oils; saturated fats are found in fatty meat, butter, palm and coconut oil, cream, cheese, ghee and lard; and
        trans-fats are found in baked and fried foods, and pre-packaged snacks and foods, such as frozen pizza, cookies,
        biscuits, and cooking oils and spreads.</p>

        <h1>4. Avoid harmful use of alcohol</h1>
        <img src="alcohol.jpg" alt="" style="height: 500px; width: 100%; border-radius: 0%;"> <br><hr><br>
       
        <p>There is no safe level for drinking alcohol. Consuming alcohol can lead to health problems such as mental and
        behavioural disorders, including alcohol dependence, major NCDs such as liver cirrhosis, some cancers and heart
        diseases, as well as injuries resulting from violence and road clashes and collisions.</p>

        <h1>5. Don’t smoke</h1>
        <img src="smoke.webp" alt="" style="height: 500px; width: 100%; border-radius: 0%;"> <br><hr><br>
       
        <p>Smoking tobacco causes NCDs such as lung disease, heart disease and stroke. Tobacco kills not only the direct
        smokers but even non-smokers through second-hand exposure. Currently, there are around 15.9 million Filipino
        adults who smoke tobacco but 7 in 10 smokers are interested or plan to quit.

        If you are currently a smoker, it’s not too late to quit. Once you do, you will experience immediate and
        long-term health benefits. If you are not a smoker, that’s great! Do not start smoking and fight for your right
        to breathe tobacco-smoke-free air.</p>

        <h1>6. Be active</h1>
        <img src="active.jpg" alt="" style="height: 500px; width: 100%; border-radius: 0%;"> <br><hr><br>
   
        <p>Physical activity is defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy
        expenditure. This includes exercise and activities undertaken while working, playing, carrying out household
        chores, travelling, and engaging in recreational pursuits. The amount of physical activity you need depends on
        your age group but adults aged 18-64 years should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical
        activity throughout the week. Increase moderate-intensity physical activity to 300 minutes per week for
        additional health benefits.</p>

        <h1>7. Check your blood pressure regularly</h1>
        <img src="blood.webp" alt="" style="height: 500px; width: 100%; border-radius: 0%;"> <br><hr><br>
  
        <p> Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is called a “silent killer”. This is because many people who have
        hypertension may not be aware of the problem as it may not have any symptoms. If left uncontrolled, hypertension
        can lead to heart, brain, kidney and other diseases. Have your blood pressure checked regularly by a health
        worker so you know your numbers. If your blood pressure is high, get the advice of a health worker. This is
        vital in the prevention and control of hypertension.</p>

        <h1>8. Get tested</h1>
        <img src="test.webp" alt="" style="height: 500px; width: 100%; border-radius: 0%;"> <br><hr><br>
       
        <p>Getting yourself tested is an important step in knowing your health status, especially when it comes to HIV,
        hepatitis B, sexually-transmitted infections (STIs) and tuberculosis (TB). Left untreated, these diseases can
        lead to serious complications and even death. Knowing your status means you will know how to either continue
        preventing these diseases or, if you find out that you’re positive, get the care and treatment that you need. Go
        to a public or private health facility, wherever you are comfortable, to have yourself tested.</p>

        <h1>9. Get vaccinated</h1>
        <img src="vaccinated.webp" alt="" style="height: 500px; width: 100%; border-radius: 0%;"> <br><hr><br>
      
        <p>Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to prevent diseases. Vaccines work with your body’s natural
        defences to build protection against diseases like cervical cancer, cholera, diphtheria, hepatitis B, influenza,
        measles, mumps, pneumonia, polio, rabies, rubella, tetanus, typhoid, and yellow fever.

        In the Philippines, free vaccines are provided to children 1 year old and below as part of the Department of
        Health’s routine immunization programme. If you are an adolescent or adult, you may ask your physician if to
        check your immunization status or if you want to have yourself vaccinated.</p>

        <h1>10. Practice safe sex</h1>
        <img src="sex.webp" alt="" style="height: 500px; width: 100%; border-radius: 0%;"> <br><hr><br>
      
        <p>Looking after your sexual health is important for your overall health and well-being. Practice safe sex to
        prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted infections like gonorrhoea and syphilis. There are available
        prevention measures such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) that will protect you from HIV and condoms that will
        protect you from HIV and other STIs.</p> <br><br><br>
